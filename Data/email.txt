Dear Customer Service,

 I am writing this because of an incident I had at your local store located in Irvine, California. 
 
 It was 9:30 AM on 11/21/2001, I was browsing your sugar cookie selection right next to the wedding cakes selection, and in between there was the ginger cookie section. There was a unique looking ginger cookie that looked upset, and it jumped on me. It attacked the cake I was holding and ate two pieces from it.
 
 I sent an email about the incident to smith.john@cakesrus.com, and this was on 11/22/2001. I did not have any response back from Mr. John Smith so I decided to email: help@cakesrus.com and the store manager kevin.smith@cakesrus.com 
 
 When I never heard back from either, I called (818)-123-4567 and Henry answered my call, he was short with me, and asked me to call 818.505.4567. I emailed Henry at smith.henry@cakesrus.com because the number he gave me never worked.
 
 I am still not happy about this situation, it is 11/25/2001 and my issue has not been resolved. The ginger cookie man is haunting my dream. Every time I see a cake, I remember the ginger man's attack on my cake.
 
 Please respond to me ASAP at smith.tarek@nothappy.com or call me at (123)555-5555 before I call the police.
 
 Regards,
 Unhappy Customer
